I recently worked on a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at exploring and understanding air pollution trends across various cities and states in India. Using a real-world dataset, I performed extensive data cleaning to ensure accuracy, including handling missing values specifically in the key pollutant metrics such as minimum, maximum, and average values. The cleaned dataset was then used for detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to generate meaningful insights. I started by analyzing the structure of the data and performed descriptive statistical analysis to get an overview of the pollutant measurements. Visualizations played a major role in this project: I created count plots to understand the distribution of different pollutant types, bar plots to compare average pollution levels across pollutant categories, and heatmaps to observe correlations between the pollutant values. One of the most insightful aspects of the analysis involved ranking cities and states based on their average pollution levels, helping to identify the top 10 most polluted areas in the dataset. Additionally, I used pair plots colored by pollutant type to detect potential patterns and clusters in pollutant behavior. The final section of the analysis included a summary of key insights such as the most commonly occurring pollutant, the total number of monitoring stations, and the geographical spread of pollution monitoring. This project not only strengthened my technical skills in data manipulation and visualization but also deepened my understanding of environmental data and the importance of analytics in public health and policy-making. It served as a great example of how data science can be used to turn raw data into actionable insights for real-world issues.
